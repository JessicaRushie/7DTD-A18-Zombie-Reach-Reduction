I got sick of the zombies "Phantom" hits so i made this.

It seems to have fixed it.

The problem IMO is that they can reach you from 1.65 metres (5.4 feet!) Assuming that "1" = 1 metre.
This is beyond the joke as there arms can NEVER be so long and all it's for is a "False difficulty".

Hope this helps.
